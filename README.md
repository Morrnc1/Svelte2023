## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of the Void Library, a web application where the world of audiobooks unfolds in an interactive and visually appealing interface. Tasked with crafting a webpage that leverages modern web design principles, I embarked on a journey through Svelte—a modern compiler that champions ease of use—to bring this vision to life.

As a novice with a limited background in web development, the challenge was formidable. The project demanded not just proficiency with the tools at hand, but also a keen eye for design and user experience. Throughout the development process, numerous iterations were conceived and discarded, each a stepping stone toward a better understanding and a clearer direction.

The culmination of this arduous endeavor is what you see before you: The Void Library. This isn't just a platform; it's a testament to the learning journey, a place where users can explore a collection of audiobooks and discover trending titles. The layout of the site draws inspiration from the well-structured and user-focused designs of sites like Royal Roads and Audible, while the navigation bar and hover effects owe their enchantment to a fantasy-themed website, adding a layer of mystique and allure to the browsing experience.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **Svelte**: A modern compiler that allows us to create reactive components using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Svelte was used for all front-end development aspects, including styling (CSS), interactive behavior (JavaScript), and markup (HTML).

- **HTML**: Hypertext Markup Language, used for structuring the content on the web page.

- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets, used for designing and layout of the web pages.

- **JavaScript (JS)**: The programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web content.

## Development Tools

- **Node.js**: The runtime environment used to run JavaScript on the server.

- **NPM**: A package manager for JavaScript, used to manage project dependencies.

- **Git**: The version control system used for source code management.

- **Visual Studio Code**: The source-code editor used for development.

Please ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before you attempt to run this project locally.

## Features

The Void Library offers a unique and immersive experience for audiobook enthusiasts and newcomers alike, with interactive elements that engage and delight. Here's what you can expect when you step into the magical world of the Void Library:

- **Interactive Welcome**: As you enter the Void Library, a hover-sensitive welcome message invites you to dive deeper. A simple click transitions you seamlessly to the home page.

Additionally, an intriguing "Releasing Soon" section keeps you informed about the upcoming titles that are about to grace the library's expansive collection.

- **Navigational Wonder**: The navigation bar, positioned on the left, is your guide to the wonders of the Void Library. It's here you can choose to "See All Books", offering a gateway to the entire repository, or visit the "About Page" to uncover the lore of the Void Library.
